# Embeddings and Querying with Chroma DB
This notebook demonstrates how to work with embeddings, using Chroma DB as a vector database for storing and querying embeddings. The focus appears to be on processing text data for potential use in applications like AI-powered chatbots or information retrieval systems, particularly within the medical domain.

Contents
1.Setup and Initialization:

Importing necessary libraries and packages (Chroma DB and Hugging Face tools).
Setting up connections to access and manage embedding data within Chroma DB.

2.Loading and Preprocessing the Data:

Then, the notebook uses the 'ruslanmv/ai-medical-chatbot' dataset is from Hugging Face.
Basic text preprocessing steps to prepare data for embedding generation.

3.Generating Embeddings:

Using a pre-trained model
Steps on how to manage and store these embeddings in Chroma DB for efficient querying.

4.Querying and Retrieving Data

Methods for querying Chroma DB using vector similarity searches.
Examples of retrieving relevant text or response data from the embeddings based on input queries.

Additional info:
Some cells (in the beginning) contain practical examples to test and understand how Chroma DB can support various query types, including filtering and ranking results based on relevance.
